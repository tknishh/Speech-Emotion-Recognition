# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
Speech Emotion Recognition – Objective
To build a model to recognize emotion from speech using the librosa and sklearn libraries and the RAVDESS dataset.

Speech Emotion Recognition – About the Python Mini Project
In this Python mini project, we will use the libraries librosa, soundfile, and sklearn (among others) to build a model using an MLPClassifier. This will be able to recognize emotion from sound files. We will load the data, extract features from it, then split the dataset into training and testing sets. Then, we’ll initialize an MLPClassifier and train the model. Finally, we’ll calculate the accuracy of our model.

The Dataset
For this Python mini project, we’ll use the RAVDESS dataset; this is the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song dataset, and is free to download. This dataset has 7356 files rated by 247 individuals 10 times on emotional validity, intensity, and genuineness. The entire dataset is 24.8GB from 24 actors, but we’ve lowered the sample rate on all the files, and you can download it here.
